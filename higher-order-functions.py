# Use the higher-order functions `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to solve these
# see this for help: https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/python_fncs_map_filter_reduce.php

## MAPPING (taking a collection and building a new collection of the same size)
# you'll want to use a map function for these
# you might need to wrap the output in `list()` to check the results

# from a list 1-50, build a list with those numbers doubled

# from a list of ['a', 'B', 'C', 'd', 'E', 'F', 'g'], build a list
# where the cases are flipped (upper to lower, lower to upper)

# from a list ['horse', 'cat', 'trash', 'apriori', 'kevin'],
# and a dictionary {'cat': 3 , 'button': 'fog', 'trash': 'balloons'}
# build a new list, based off the first, where each element is either the
# value corresponding to the key in the dictionary, or Nothing

# CATAMORPHISM (destruction) (taking a collection and building a non-collection)
# use the `reduce` function for these

# from a list 1-50, get the sum of all the elements

# from a list 1-50, get the product of all the elements

# from a list [1,6,2,4,2,9,11,4,8], get the maximum element

# from the same list as the above, get the minumum element

# from a list 1-50, get the sum of all the even elements

# FILTERING (taking a collection and returning a collection of the same size or smaller
# use the `filter` function for these

# from a list 1-50, get a list of just the even elements

# from a list 1-50, get a list of all the elements divisible by 3

# from a list of a-z, get a list of the consenents
